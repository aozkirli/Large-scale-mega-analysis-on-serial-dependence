2. Prohibited Use

I shall not:
 (a) Use the dataset for commercial purposes, or redistribute the dataset (or substantial subsets) without including this license.
 (b) Attempt to re-identify any participant or link the data to personal information.
 (c) Use the dataset for clinical, diagnostic, or individual decision-making.
